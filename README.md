# Financial Statements Generator

This project generates Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements for a given year using SQL queries and a stored procedure. It includes additional features like percentage change, headings, and financial metrics.

## Instructions

The SQL code provided achieves the following tasks:

1. Receives a year as an argument to produce P&L and B/S statements.
2. Calculates net profit or loss for the specified year.
3. Uses the calculated value to generate the B/S.
4. Demonstrates the equation A = L + E.
5. Prints clear P&L and B/S on Result Grids.
6. Shows the % change vs. the previous year for major line items.
7. Adds headings to each major account line item and each section of the P&L and B/S.
8. Includes additional financial metrics and ratios.

To achieve an "A," the project challenges you to produce a cash flow statement.

## How to Use

1. Download the SQL script.
2. Execute the script on your SQL database.
3. View the Result Grids to see the generated P&L and B/S.
